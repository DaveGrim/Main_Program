# Ingredient Substitute Microservice

This microservice provides a list of substitute ingredients based on a single input string. It is designed to support another program (e.g., a Recipe Manager backend) via ZeroMQ using the REQâ€“REP pattern.

---

## ðŸ”— Communication Contract

### Requesting Data (from your backend)

Your program must send a message to the microservice using ZeroMQ in the format:

- `<ingredient>` must be a single-word or phrase describing the ingredient you want substitutes for (e.g., `"milk"`).
- All requests should be sent using `socket.send_string(...)`.

### Example (Python pseudocode):

```python
socket.send_string("substitute:milk")
```
### Receving Data

The microservice will return one of the following:

- A JSON list of substitute strings if substitutes are found (e.g., `["almond milk", "soy milk", "oat milk"]`)
- A plain string `"No substitute found"` if there is no match

### Example (Python pseudocode):

```python
reply = socket.recv()

try:
    substitutes = json.loads(reply.decode())
    print("Substitutes:", substitutes)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Message:", reply.decode())
```

Below is a high-level representation of the communication pattern between your backend and this microservice:

+---------------+          +-------------------------------+
| Your Backend  |          | Ingredient Substitute Service |
+---------------+          +-------------------------------+
       |                              |
       |  send_string("substitute:X") |
       |----------------------------->|
       |                              |
       |       look up substitute     |
       |                              |
       |         send_json([...])     |
